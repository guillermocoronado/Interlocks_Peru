# Interlocks_Peru

This is the code used for the research project "Influence of geographical origin on the formation of interlocking directorates between top firms in Peru"

The main objectiven of the paper was to determine if there is, in fact, a division in the Peruvian business elite according to the origin of the family economic groups. Authors like Figueroa (2004) and Durand (2017) hace argued that "emerging" family groups, originating from the interior of the country, have not managed to integrate into the traditional elite, made up of businessmen mainly from Lima or foreigners, due to cultural reasons. Nevertheless, while Durand (2017) did not analyze directly the relationships between firms, Figueroa (2004) did have enough data of "emergent" firms. In this paper, we tried to analyze this topic using interlocking directorates as a measure of relatedness. The main analysis used were density analysis by attributes, community detection and betweeness analysis of directors
